# Preface {.unnumbered}

This document serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it acts as a repository for code snippets and concepts that I have found to be highly valuable. Secondly, it functions as a "how-to" guide for topics that may not be explicitly explained in other online resources. Thirdly, it serves as a quick reference for code that I frequently use but sometimes struggle to recall the correct format. Lastly, it provides a roadmap to enhance my competency in sport analytic processes.

In short, this is my [Feynman technique](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/ "https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/") for sports analytics in R.
