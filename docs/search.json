Secondly, it functions as a “how-to” guide for topics that may not be explicitly explained in other online resources. Thirdly, it serves as a quick reference for code that I frequently use but sometimes struggle to recall the correct format. Lastly, it provides a roadmap to enhance competency in sport analytic processes."
